# About
**This application allows you to fetch travel articles from different sources.**
- All articles should be linked to the location described in the article.
- Articles could have images that could be liked or not by users to monitor how images affect users' attention
- The user will be able to prepare a review for every article in the database

> [!WARNING]
> The user could choose an article by image. There will be a displayed gallery of images without any text that furthers to articles (interesting experiment)
> The user could also choose an article on a map (pin on the map or near you (radius 100km)) thanks to the location.

# Admin

- import and aggregate articles from other web resources.
